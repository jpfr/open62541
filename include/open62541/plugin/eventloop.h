/**
 * Event Loop Subsystem
 * ====================
 *
 * An OPC UA-enabled application can have several clients and servers. And
 * server can serve different transport-level protocols for OPC UA. The
 * EventLoop is a central module that provides a unified control-flow for all of
 * these. Hence, several applications can share an EventLoop.
 *
 * The EventLoop and the ConnectionManager implementation is
 * architecture-specific. The goal is to have a single call to "poll" (epoll,
 * kqueue, ...) in the EventLoop that covers all ConnectionManagers. Hence the
 * EventLoop plugin implementation must know implementation details of the
 * ConnectionManager implementations. So the EventLoop can extract socket
 * information, etc. from the ConnectionManagers.
 *
 * Event Loop
 * ----------
 * The EventLoop implementation is part of the selected architecture. For
 * example, "Win32/POSIX" stands for a Windows environment with an EventLoop
 * that uses the POSIX API. Several EventLoops can be instantiated in parallel.
 * But the globally defined functions are the same everywhere. */

 * - Passive Connection (Listening on a port for incoming connections)
